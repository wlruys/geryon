# Geryon Config Reference (Legacy Pointer)

This page is kept for compatibility with older links.

Current documentation is split into dedicated pages:

- `docs/experiments.md`: full experiment YAML schema and merge/predicate semantics.
- `docs/packs.md`: composition (`imports`/`option_sets`/`packs`/`groups`/`select`) and expansion rules.
- `docs/profiles.md`: `profiles.yaml` schema and runtime precedence.
- `docs/runtime-artifacts.md`: generated files and status model.
- `docs/interface.md`: CLI contract.

Use the MkDocs site (`mkdocs.yml`) for the full navigation structure.
